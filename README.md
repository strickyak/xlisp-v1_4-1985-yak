# xlisp-v1_4-1985-yak
Resurrecting XLISP, Version 1.4 (January 1, 1985), by David Betz

`github.com/strickyak/xlisp-v1_4-1985-yak`

## Why?

I used XLISP 1.4 in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a scripting and extension language.
I liked it because the C code was well-written and well-documented,
and the manual was only 34 pages.
I was not very experienced with Lisp, but found it easy to get started with XLISP,
and easy to extend the interpreter.

(Later Tcl became my scripting and extension language of choice,
but it was not publically released until 1990,
and I did not find out about it until a couple of years later,
when I was designing my own language somewhat similar to Tcl.)

More recent versions of XLISP exist and unless you're just in a
retro computing mood like I am, you should probably check out
http://www.xlisp.org/ and
http://www.edm2.com/index.php/The_XLISP_family .

## What?

I'm hoping to get this compiling again on modern amd64 gcc.

In this starting point, I see I have an old x86 linux binary
that seems to work.  I must have made it some time ago.
Also I'm modifying the files to append `.txt` onto the end of `xlisp.doc`,
since it's ASCII text, and not what the world expects a `.doc` file to be.

## Not Open Source

This is not Open Source, but was released on Usenet by the author.

Notice in the first paragraph of the introduction
of the file `xlisp.doc.txt`:

```
It is available  in
source   form   free  of  charge  to  non-commercial  users.
Prospective commercial users should contact the  author  for
permission to use XLISP.
```
